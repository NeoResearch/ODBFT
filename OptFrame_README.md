The OptFrame project was hosted in SourceForge.net for 8 years and we are 
very grateful for all support during this time. Thanks to this support, we
have published several academic papers and solved many large scale problems
during these years. In order to easily interact with new project collaborators
the project is now moved to GitHub platform.

Thanks a lot SourceForge/GitHub!
