## Optimized Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance


This project is in its early stages, it contains basic structures for the design of optimization strategies focused on Neo Consensus.
First of all, [neo-integration-test](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neo-integration-tests) will be the base project that will allow us to concisely run the proposed experiments.
In particular, the flexibility of metaheuristics, and mathematical programming models, will be explored.

Due to the complexity and critical need of ensuring trust and efficiency, a multi-objective approach will, probably, be taken into account.
Furthermore, taking hand of this multi-objective optimization, the proposed model is going to try to find a consensus that balances risk, quality and high speed communication between different Neo ecosystem interfaces (each pair could be seen as an objective, forming the desired Pareto Front).
After the optimization step, multi-criteria decision making will be applied in order to assist nodes decision in real-time blockchain operation.

In summary, it has the potential of enhancing consensus capabilities, speed and robustness, taking into account multi-agent systems protocols and using high performance computing techniques.


### Next steps
* It is not discarded that it will involve the resolution of graph mathematical programming models;
* On the other hand, it is expected that the problem described and handled here will fit inside the class of NP-Hard problems. In this sense, it may exponentially require costly and precious computational resources when handling real-time operation;
* Possible, this project can be merged with the aforementioned [neo-integration-test](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neo-integration-tests). This would be a reasonable and smart strategy if the proposed real-time self-tunning parameters TestNet also becomes reality.
