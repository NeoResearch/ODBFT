## Optimized Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance

This is an open-source initiative for providing an efficient fast strategy for guaranteeing NEO blockchain to be fault tolerant.

This project contains optimization strategies for optimizing Neo Consensus.

In particular, the flexibility of metaheuristics will be used in order to achieve robust and efficient consensus.

Due to the complexity and critical need of ensuring trust and efficiency, a multi-objective approach is taken into account.
Taking hand of this multi-objective optimization, the proposed model tries to find a consensus that balances risk, quality and efficiency.
After the optimization step, multi-criteria decision making will be applied in order to assist nodes decision in real-time blockchain operation.

### Next steps
* It is not discarded that it may use the power of mathematical programming models. On the other hand, it is expected that the problem described and handled here will fit inside the class of NP-Hard problems. Thus, it may exponentially require costly computational resources when handling real scenarios.
