NeoResearch

This project contains an optimization strategies for optimizing Neo Consensus,  guaranteeing fault tolerance.
In particular, the flexibility of metaheuristics are power of mathematical programming models are used in order to
achieve robust and efficient consensus.
Due to the complexity and critical need of ensuring trust and immutability, trust and efficiency are taken into account.
Taking hand of a multi-objective optimization, the proposed model tries to find a consensus that balances
risk and quality.
Multi-criteria decision making is then applied in order to assist nodes decision in real-time blockchain operation.
